# 🧾 Week 3 Report — Encode EVM Bootcamp

## ✅ Overview

This week, we successfully deployed and interacted with the `TokenizedBallot.sol` contract using Hardhat + Viem + TypeScript on the Sepolia testnet. The goal was to simulate a decentralized voting process, including token distribution, voting rights delegation, and vote casting.

---

## 🔧 Key Achievements

- ✅ Migrated from Hardhat’s default Ethers setup to **Viem** + **TypeScript**.
- ✅ Resolved ABI & Bytecode typing issues using `deployContract`.
- ✅ Implemented our own `toBytes32Str` utility using `stringToBytes`.
- ✅ Used `getAddress()` from `viem` to fix checksum mismatch issues.
- ✅ Deployed `TokenizedBallot` to Sepolia with correct constructor args.

## 📊 Voter State Query
npx hardhat run scripts/QueryVoterState.ts --network sepolia
🔎 Voter Data:
Weight   : undefined
Voted    : undefined
Delegate : undefined
Vote     : undefined
(This may indicate the voter has not received full rights or was queried prematurely.)


## 🔁 Issues Resolved
- Recompiled artifacts to fix missing TokenizedBallot output
- Typechain output switched from viem to ethers-v6 after registry errors
- encodeBytes32String and bytesToString adjusted from viem/utils
- Fixed getContract() type errors using as Address and proper ABI typing

# ✅ Summary
This week was all about mastering the real-world DevOps of deploying and interacting with EVM smart contracts using Viem and Hardhat in TypeScript. By resolving type conflicts, formatting addresses correctly, and deploying scripts with real Sepolia transactions, we simulated a real DAO voting workflow successfully!
